Starter Files

### Classes and IDs <small>([download]({{ site.baseurl }}/starters/classes_and_ids.zip))</small>

HTML elements can be given classes by adding an attribute like `class="foo"`, and can be given an ID by adding an attribute like `id="bar"`.

These can in turn, be selected for in CSS using `.foo` (selects elements with `class="foo"` and `#bar` (selects elements with `id="bar"`.

We'll start looking at how to decide when to use these flexible features of HTML and CSS.

### Fashion Blog <small>([download]({{ site.baseurl }}/starters/fashion_blog.zip)) ([preview]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/fashion_blog/))</small>

We'll be building out a redesign for our fashion blog.



Before Class
------------

Floats are difficult to get used to, possibly the mind-fuckiest thing we will work on in class. For that reason, please give these articles a read before class on Monday, preferably twice each:

* [All About Floats](http://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/) by Chris Coyier
* [CSS Floats 101](http://alistapart.com/article/css-floats-101) by Noah Stokes

This is funky material, and is a sticky point for everyone (and I mean *everyone*). The truth is that using `float` and `clear` for page layouts is essentially a hack, but for now, it's the best option we have.

We will be looking at this more in class, but things will definitely go a bit smoother with a head start.
