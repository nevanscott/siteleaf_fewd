* Startup Matchmaker <small>(in pairs)</small>


Starter Files
-------------

### Startup Matchmaker <small>([download]({{ site.baseurl }}/starters/startup_matchmaker.zip)) ([preview]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/startup_matchmaker/))</small>

A new marketing website for an imaginary startup.

We'll start off by drawing diagrams together so that we have a schematic to follow as we build.


Before Class
------------

Start looking over the [Startup Matchmaker]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/startup_matchmaker/) page, to get a feel for what you'll be building.
