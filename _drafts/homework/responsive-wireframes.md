If you'd like some hopefully helpful guidance, here are my versions of the wireframes that were assigned in class:

* [Wireframe 1](http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/CLhzG)
* [Wireframe 2](http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/fFHmA)

### Homework

The set labelled "Homework" is required for this assignment.

### Challenge

"Challenge" is the same as the challenge I drew on the board in class. It is not quite as difficult as I imagined when I drew in on the board, but still more work than the one labelled "Homework". I encourage you to at least take an honest stab at this one, it will be very good practice.

### Impossible

"Impossible" is what I meant to draw in class. A friend of mine who has been a professional front-end web developer for many years looked that layout over and told me that it isn't possible to do using CSS. So for those of you with a "Challenge accepted!" mindset, this is the one for you. Good luck.
